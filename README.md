# robloxvirtualguitartabplayer
A guitar tab player for a roblox virtual guitar game.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required modules with:

```bash
pip install guitarpro pynput
```
This is necessary for the script to work properly.

## Usage

Run the script and select a tab file (Only .gp3, .gp4 and .gp5 are supported). Choose which part of the tab you intend to play and choose desired or original BPM.

I highly recommend getting TuxGuitar to convert any tab files to the supported formats.

As the game has some flaws, you wont be able to play certain songs correctly due to the game only having 0-12 frets, and chords can sound really really horrible. Awesome for leads though.
